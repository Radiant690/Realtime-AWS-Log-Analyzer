## In-Depth Introduction to Services

### AWS S3

📂 AWS S3 is used in this solution to store log data. It provides a cost-effective way to store data in the cloud with its tiered storage availability and lifecycle management features. With S3, you can set rules for immediate data to be stored in the main storage, then move it to infrequent access mode after a certain amount of time, and finally move it to Glacier/archival storage as needed.

### AWS Lambda

🚀 AWS Lambda is used in this solution to process log data and trigger other AWS services. It provides a scalable and cost-effective way to run code without the need for managing servers.

### AWS CloudWatch

📊 AWS CloudWatch is used in this solution to monitor log data and trigger alerts based on specific metrics. It provides a centralized way to store and analyze log data.

### AWS Elasticsearch

🔎 AWS Elasticsearch is used in this solution to index and search log data. It provides a scalable and efficient way to search and analyze large volumes of log data.
